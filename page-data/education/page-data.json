The mediators of the strong interaction, the gluons, couple to quarks in a peculiar way: at high energies the coupling constant is small and a perturbative approach works reasonably well; however at low energies, the coupling constant becomes large and a perturbative approach fails. Thus one needs to study the hadronic spectrum using models, where each has its own caveats, or use an a-priori method, where only the quark masses and the strong coupling constant are needed as input. Such a method is lattice field theory. This theory is most often applied to QCD and in that case it is called lattice QCD.</p>\n<p>Understanding the spectrum of a nonperturbative non-abelian gauge theory turns out to be very difficult. The primary question is how the particles of the spectrum, in the case of QCD these are the mesons and the baryons, show themselves in the S-matrix. Are they bound states or are they resonances. Where do their poles lie? And what are the couplings to the various channels? How do the poles evolve, if the quark masses are changed - can resonances become bound states? How high can resonance go? What determines the number of bound states and resonances in the spectrum? </p>\n<p>While knowing more and more about hadrons is indeed very interesting, we also want to use what we already know in search for the yet-unknown. This is where transitions between heavy mesons and light resonances enter - for example, there is still room for large new-physics contributions in several types of flavor-changing processes, mostly those involving bottom quarks - one of the major puzzles in flavor physics concerns the CKM matrix element $V<em>{ub}$ which appears in the b → ulν transitions. In the Standard Model of Particle Physics, these occur at the tree level through a W-boson exchange, and currently there is a discrepancy between the extractions of $V</em>{ub}$ from inclusive (when a B-meson decays to all possible light hadrons and lepton-anti-neutrino pair) and exclusive (currently only the decay of a B-meson to a pion and lepton-anti-neutrino pair) analyses. </p>"},{"url":"/contact/","relativePath":"contact.md","relativeDir":"","base":"contact.md","name":"contact","frontmatter":{"title":"Contact","img_path":"images/contact.jpg","seo":{"title":"Contact","description":"Get in Touch","extra":[{"name":"og:type","value":"website","keyName":"property"},{"name":"og:title","value":"Contact","keyName":"property"},{"name":"og:description","value":"Get in touch","keyName":"property"},{"name":"og:image","value":"images/contact.jpg","keyName":"property","relativeUrl":true}]},"template":"page"},"html":"<p>If you would like to get it in touch, you can find some contact info on my <a href=\"https://inspirehep.net/authors/1223659?ui-citation-summary=true\">INSPIRE</a> profile, or on my <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_9KQt18AAAAJ&#x26;hl=en\">Google Scholar</a> profile.

There are numerous way to calculate QCD observabless, but at low energies - where hadrons appear, the only reliable a-priori method is lattice QCD - a numerical method to calculate the Feynman path integrals of QCD using large supercomputers. It allows us to calculate a variety hadronic observables needed to better understand hadrons, and their building blocks. </p>\n<p>My primary interests lie in hadrons and their properties such as mass, decay widths, branching fractions, as well as the various transitions that can occur between hadrons. These transitions can provide valuable Standard Model parameters, which can be compared to experimental measurements and tested for New Physics contributions. But studying hadrons is not just about building a dictionary of parameters - it is also trying to understand what hadrons are made of, how do their building blocks come together and what is the interplay between quarks and gluons.</p>\n<p>While my research is my true passion, sanity demands an outlet: my mind likes distractions such as books - I am fan of fantasy and science fiction.</p>"},{"url":"/coding/","relativePath":"coding.md","relativeDir":"","base":"coding.md","name":"coding","frontmatter":{"title":"Coding","subtitle":null,"img_path":"images/code2.jpg","seo":{"title":"Coding - Luka Leskovec","description":"Coding - Luka Leskovec","extra":[{"name":"og:type","value":"website","keyName":"property"},{"name":"og:title","value":"Coding - Luka Leskovec","keyName":"property"},{"name":"og:description","value":"Coding - Luka Leskovec","keyName":"property"},{"name":"og:image","value":"images/about.jpg","keyName":"property","relativeUrl":true}]},"template":"page"},"html":"<p>At some point in life I read the following quote somewhere: “There are only two kinds of programming languages out there. The ones people complain about and the ones no one uses.” It strips down coding and human nature - if we use it we complain about it, and if we don't use it we don't complain.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately - as wise that quote is, it misses the most important aspect of coding - coding is arguably the most useful tool in understanding a problem and it's solution. In three simple steps you understand you problem, solve it and learn its caveats: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>first, you disassemble the problem down to its basic operations and building blocks, </li>\n<li>second, you write the code for the building blocks, </li>\n<li>finally you combine it all into one whole entity we call an app or a program. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Below you will find my favorite programming languages - ones I use on a daily basis or weekly basis.</p>\n<h3>C language</h3>\n<p>C is a great language, in fact it was the first language I ever coded in. Unfortunately, I was not a big fan of allocating and deallocating my memory so I really only used it in class. These days, it's I use it here and then, but mostly by necessity rather than choice.</p>\n<h3>C++ language</h3>\n<p>C++ is currently my favorite and my go-to language to code in. In practice it's the logical heir to C, but in reality it has evolved so much the C-part of C++ is almost unnoticable. It's has a bunch of convenient libraries, containers, and almosta all the debugging is already solved on the internet ;)</p>\n<h3>Fortran</h3>\n<p>Fortran was my go-to language for a while, and today it has sentimental value. It was the first language I made usable programs in. It was also the programming language that tought me the three most important aspects of coding: first make the code run, second make it right, third make it fast.</p>\n<h3>python</h3>\n<p>On one hand, python is a great language when you need to do something fast and need to visualize it as well. The awesome libraries one can find in python provide (almost) everything needed to visualize data. Even C/C++ code interfaces well to python, which I find so coool. On the other hand I hate python from the bottom of my heart.</p>\n<h3>Mathematica</h3>\n<p>While Mathematica is very powerful tool that I have been using for a long time - I still feel only as a begginer. </p>"}],"site":{"siteMetadata":{"palette":"blue","header":{"title":"Luka Leskovec","tagline":"Luka Leskovec","logo_img":"images/logo-2.png","logo_img_alt":"luka","background_img":"images/luka.jpg","has_nav":true,"nav_links":[{"label":"ABOUT","url":"/about","style":"link"},{"label":"EDUCATION","url":"/education","style":"link"},{"label":"RESEARCH","url":"/research","style":"link"},{"label":"CODING","url":"/coding","style":"link"},{"label":"PUBLICATIONS","url":"/publications","style":"link"},{"label":"CONTACT","url":"/contact","style":"link"}],"has_social":false,"social_links":[{"label":"Twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/","style":"icon","icon_class":"twitter","new_window":true},{"label":"Instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/","style":"icon","icon_class":"instagram","new_window":true},{"label":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/","style":"icon","icon_class":"github","new_window":true},{"label":"LinkedIn","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/","style":"icon","icon_class":"linkedin","new_window":true},{"label":"DEV","url":"https://dev.to/","style":"icon","icon_class":"dev","new_window":true}]},"footer":{"content":""},"title":"Luka Leskovec"},"pathPrefix":"","data":{}},"menus":{}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
