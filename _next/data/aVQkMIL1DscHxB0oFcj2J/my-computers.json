In practice it's the logical heir to C and is the predominant language in scientific computing these days. I find it very flexible but a very big language - I learn something new about it almost every day.\n\n### C language\n\nC is a great language, C++'s grandfather and not that different from Fortran -- but mostly today I would just pick C++... ;)\n\n### Fortran\n\nFortran has sentimental value to me as I started coding in Fortran.  My first fortran program was in undergrad and I still find \"Fortran-code\" easiest to write - even in other languages. \n\n### python\n\nPython is a great language when you need to do something fast and need to visualize it as well. The awesome libraries one can found in python provide (almost) everything needed to visualize data. As a side note, C/C++ interface well to python, which I find so coool. On the other hand beware of global variables ;)\n\n### Mathematica\n\nWhile Mathematica is very powerful tool I am only a begginer. Many would likely say, that using Mathematica for solving equations analytically, calculating integrals and finding eigenvalues barely scratches its surface. I think that is likely true...\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/education.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"content/pages","relSourcePath":"education.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/education.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"page","modelLabel":"Page","urlPath":"/education"},"frontmatter":{"title":"EDUCATION","seo":{"title":"education","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[],"type":"stackbit_page_meta"},"layout":"page"},"markdown":"# The Young Years\n\nI started attending Gimnazija Jurija Vege in Idrija, Slovenia \\[High School] in 2002, where I had the most fun in math and chemistry classes. It is in chemistry, that I first learned of the \"quantum nature\" of things, when I first heard of atomic orbitals. This had a huge effect one me - to such extent, that for a while I wanted to study chemistry. Soon enough I learned that it was not chemistry that focused on quantum effects, but rather physics. So when I finished High School in 2006 as a \"Zlati Maturant\" and had to choose what to do with my life I decided to study Physics.\n\n\n\n# University Years\n\nI started my studies at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of University in Ljubljana, Slovenia in autumn 2006. As the early years of Physics studying dont put that much focus on Modern Physics I forgot how much I was impressed by quantum mechanics in High School until the third year of my studies, when I listened to the Quantum Mechanics course. In that class I finally got to learn about the part of physics I fell in love with so long ago. A particularly important part of the class was at the end of the course when Feynmann Path Integrals were briefly discussed: that was enough motivation for me to read the Feynmann, Hibbs book on Path Integrals. From that moment on I knew the secret -- Physics is it.\n\nLater, near the end of my studies I learned where the Path Integrals are actually used, and that is lattice field theory. And it turned out that they are a powerful tool for understanding modern day nonperturbative physics. It is then that I met my mentor, dr. Sasa Prelovsek Komelj, where I soon after did my diploma thesis: Pion Kaon scattering in lattice QCD.\n\n\n\n# Graduate School\n\nIn 2011 I became a PhD student at the Department of Theoretical Physics at Jozef Stefan Institute, where I finished my PhD in June 2015 under the mentorship of dr. Sasa Prelovsek Komelj and dr. Daniel Mohler.\n\n\n\n# Postdoc Life\n\nAt the end of August 2015 I started working with dr. Stefan Meinel at the Department of Physics of the University of Arizona, where we used the recent extension of the Lellouch-Luescher formalism by Raul Briceno and its applications in determining the rho resonance radiative decay width.\n\nIn 2019 I moved to JLab where I started working with the Hadron Spectrum collaboration, where I continue my research on resonance and transitions.\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/index.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"content/pages","relSourcePath":"index.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/index.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"advanced","modelLabel":"Advanced Page","urlPath":"/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Home","hide_title":true,"sections":[{"section_id":"hero","type":"section_hero","title":"Luka Leskovec"},{"section_id":"about","type":"section_content","content":"I am a postdoc in the the field of hadronic physics.

The mediators of the strong interaction, the gluons, couple to quarks in a peculiar way: at high energies the coupling constant is small and a perturbative approach works reasonably well; however at low energies, the coupling constant becomes large and a perturbative approach fails. Thus one needs to study the hadronic spectrum using models, where each has its own caveats, or use an a priori method, where only the quark masses and the strong coupling constant are needed as input. Such a method is lattice field theory. This theory is most often applied to QCD and in that case it is called lattice QCD.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the spectrum of a nonperturbative non-abelian gauge theory turns out to be very difficult. The primary question is how the particles of the spectrum, in the case of QCD these are the mesons and the baryons, show themselves in the S-matrix. Are they bound states or are they resonances. If they are resonances what are their decay channels, decay widths and branching fractions. How do the states of the spectrum behave, if the parameters of the theory are changed - can resonances become bound states? How high can resonance go? What determines the number of bound states and resonances in the spectrum? These are just some of the questions I would like to know the answers to before The End.\n\n\n\nWhile the above questions are already incredibly interesting, one can dig deeper. Intuitively we would like to know, how these hadrons look like; what is the quark and gluon content of specific hadrons and how does this affect the interactions between hadrons. Can we visualize these reactions in a rigorous manner, so that together with the decay processes we also understand how these decays happen? This is what my research is focused on at the moment.\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/publications.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"content/pages","relSourcePath":"publications.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/publications.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"page","modelLabel":"Page","urlPath":"/publications"},"frontmatter":{"title":"PUBLICATIONS","img_alt":"no-alt","seo":{"title":"publications","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[],"type":"stackbit_page_meta"},"layout":"page"},"markdown":"### Published works\n\n1\\) Briceno, R.A., Dudek, J.J., Leskovec, L. :: <span\nclass=\"nocase\">Constraining 1 + 𝒥 → 2 coupled-channel amplitudes in\nfinite-volume</span>.
